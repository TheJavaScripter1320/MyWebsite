        <h3> CODING </h3>
        <p> I like coding because it gives me a sense of pride from what I've made. It's extremely addicting and fun as well so no wonder. Coding also expands my creativity. HTML so I can make my websites and JS for my games. Coding is how my dreams become true when I make them. I want to make games with it because they entertain me. I want to make websites because they represent me. In conclusion, coding is just my thing, I love it, it's fun, and it helps express me. </p>

        <h3> CROCHETING </h3>
        <p> I like crocheting because I can make cool stuff like amigurumi and doidles. It also makes me feel like I've accomplished something! And the best part is I have something to help me relax. Crocheting is a good way to pass the time. It's a wonderful way to make money too trust me. Crochet also benefits my creativity so when I think of something, I can create it to be real. I can express myself to others. I can simply show what I think with it. </p>

        <h3> COOKING </h3>
        <p> I like cooking because it's productive, fun, and makes good for looking responsible. Cooking is simply productive because you're making food instead of wasting gallons of water to get it delivered to you. It's also fun because I can flip crepes and scramble eggs. Cooking is more than a pan and batter, it's pleasing your stomach with whatever you make. Yeah that sounded a little weird but you know what I mean. I know it sounds boring but to me it's fun. When I think of cooking, I think of eggs and toasts for breakfast. I can occasionally cook for my family whenever it's time to eat. I feel like I provide for them and also feel like they are very grateful. I just like cooking because what I make at the end always looks delicious and makes me feel responsible. </p>
