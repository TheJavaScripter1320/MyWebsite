        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <br>
        <p> I'm Aaron G and I live in Los Angeles. I'm just into middle school and I'm very interesting. I like crocheting, cooking, and coding! My dream job/occupation isn't defined to me yet but I want it to involve coding for sure.</p>
        <br>
        <h2> Why I took this class </h2>
        <br>
        <p> I took this class on accident thinking it was just about staying safe on the internet ( cybersecurity ). My friends said it was boring so when I saw it I was obviously upset. It was when I got a glimpse of it that I actually liked it and wanted to stay with it! I tried coding in the past with python but I would get lazy the next day.</p>
