        <p> My game's objective is to fight off aliens with a simple laser beam. I make it in coding class and with the time I had, I made 371 lines of code. My only challenge which wasn't exactly the hardest thing I've seen was getting the timing of the alien appearances to work. Everything else was simple. I plan on expanding the game in the future in a website. A remake and redoing all the features from scratch so I can make my game accessible.</p>
